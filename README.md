👋, 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with high social and environmental impact.
📫 How to reach me: Look me up on linkedin or send me a tweet :baby_chick:

My main interest at work is understanding how principles of Total Quality Management affect decisions made during application design. The short answer: it makes a big difference not just in the final product but in the process. I'm currently working on expanding these ideas (coming soon to this space).

I’ve always been interested in the disconnect between what is obvious and what is intuitive: it is no coincidence that things that seem obvious _after_ hearing them weren't when first introduced. 

# Topics of interest
 - TQM frameworks for enterprise applications, 
 - Open software as a vehicle for change
