👋, 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with high social and environmental impact.
📫 How to reach me: Look me up on linkedin or send me a tweet :baby_chick:

My main interest at work is understanding how principles of Total Quality Management affect decisions made during application design. The short answer: it makes a big difference not just in the final product but in the process. I'm currently working on expanding these ideas in the form of a book and repo (coming soon to this space).

I’ve always been interested in the cognitive disconnect between what is obvious and what is intuitive: it is no coincidence that things that seem obvious _after_ hearing them weren't when first developed. 

# Topics of interest
 - TQM frameworks for enterprise applications, 
 - open software
